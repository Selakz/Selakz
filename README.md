### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here is Senolytics/Selakz, a student majoring in Software Engineering.

For now, I'm just working on my first unity project, Project DL.<br/>
Currently I'm very skilless. It would be quite an honor if you spare your time to have a glimpse on my projects and give some guides.

That's it.
