### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[![Selakz's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Selakz&show_icons=true&hide_border=true&theme=dark)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

This is Senolytics/Selakz, a student majoring in Software Engineering.

Senolytics is a type of drugs that target and eliminate senescent cells. I chose this name for my online presence to symbolize my desire to discard old prejudices and constraints, continually embrace new things, and maintain curiosity and vitality.

My greatest wish is to always pursue what truly interests me. I love exploring various frameworks and creating indie games, and I wish my voice can be heard by the world.

However, my current knowledge is still too shallow to offer critical opinions on many things, and my contributions are quite minimal. I hope to have many experiences worth sharing in the future to fill this profile, and I will strive for this.

That's it.
